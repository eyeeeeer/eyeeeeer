# Hi there, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

I am a student from Ukraine who is engaged in programming and writes his projects. I am currently learning some programming languages and also writing a lot of projects in **JavaScript**. Mostly now I develop websites and bots for the **Discord** messenger, but I am also a little familiar with technologies such as **electron.js** and **React Native**, but I have not written applications for them yet...


- ðŸ”­ Right now I'm mainly working on **Discord** bots and sites for them.

## Skills
At the beginning of 2020, I began to learn programming on my own in JavaScript, which I still write. At the end of 2021, I started learning Python minimally, but I haven't written anything in it yet. Somewhere since March 2022, I decided to learn TypeScript more and now I am actively engaged in this.
